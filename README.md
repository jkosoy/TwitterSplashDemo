Twitter Splash Screen
========================

![Twitter Splash Screen](demo.gif "Twitter Splash Screen")


This is a rough demo I put together to showcase [CFAAction](https://github.com/CodaFi/CFAAction) in conjunction with [AHEasing](https://github.com/warrenm/AHEasing) to support robust easing in Core Animation. It takes far many many more lines of code to draw the Twitter logo than it does to actually animate it.

This app makes use of [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org). To set up, first clone or download this repository to your computer. Then, using your Terminal Prompt...

```
cd /path/to/this/repo
pod install
```

Open the TwitterSplash.xcworkspace file and you should be able to compile. Enjoy!
